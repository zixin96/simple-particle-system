# simple-particle-system
This is a simple particle system using WebGL as display.

## Features

1. Two forces have been implemented to affect the spheres: gravity and friction.
2. Left click the mouse to add 3 spheres. 
3. If you minimize the window or switch to another tab in your browser, the particles may behave strangely since the canvas does not get updated under the circumstance. You can press "r" to reset the scene.
